**Problem Statement: Predicting Total Fare for Taxi Services**

Accurately predicting taxi ride fares is crucial for both taxi companies and passengers. This project aims to develop predictive models that estimate the total fare for taxi rides based on various trip-related factors.

**Data Dictionary:**

•	trip_duration: Duration of the trip in seconds.

•	distance_traveled: Distance covered during the trip in miles.

•	num_of_passengers: Number of passengers in the taxi.

•	tip: Additional amount paid as a tip by the passenger.

•	miscellaneous_fees: Any additional fees applicable, such as tolls or extra charges.

•	total_fare: Total fare paid for the taxi ride.

•	surge_applied: Binary indicator (0 or 1) indicating if surge pricing was applied.

**Selection Criteria:** The selected independent variables (trip_duration, distance_traveled, num_of_passengers, tip, miscellaneous_fees, surge_applied) influence the total fare passengers pay. These variables capture the essential components of a taxi ride (duration, distance, passengers) and additional factors that affect fare calculation (tips, fees, surge pricing).

These variables are expected to have significant predictive power in estimating total fare, providing insights into fare dynamics, and optimizing fare estimation systems for taxi companies.
